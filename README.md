motor
=====

Motor is a goal tracker for groups. It allows every group member to set their own goals while forcing them to commit themselves to a fixed agenda.

The agenda for a group is defined cyclically by the group members. A cycle defaults to a duration of 7 days. Before its start, each group member defines their goals for the coming cycle. At the first day of the cycle these goals are fixed and published to everyone else. Through this process, a better estimate of one's own work pace is gained.
